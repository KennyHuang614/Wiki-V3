# Battery Info


There are two battery configurations that can be used.
Batteries are what power your robot. There are two types of batteries: the small vex batteries <sub>(7.2V)</sub> that power your electronics and the big ones that power your motors <sub>(12V)</sub>


Option 1 - Single 12V Battery
***DO NOT DIRECTLY CONNECT THE POSITIVE END AND THE NEGATIVE END OF THE BATTERY.*** This could break the battery and melt other components of the robot.


## Big Batteries
You are able to change the configurations of big batteries. The usage of these differing configuration may vary based on what type of robot you are building.There are two battery configurations that can be used.


-Option 1 - Single 12V Battery <sub>(12V)</sub>


This option is for robots without any active weapons. The benefit of using this configuration is that the robot can be lighter and easier to maneuver. However, using solely a 12V battery will limit the power of the wheels and shorten how long the battery lasts.


Option 2 - Two 12V Batteries in Series
-Option 2 - Two 12V Batteries in Series <sub>(24V)</sub>


This configuration is **mandatory** if you would like to design a robot with an active weapon. Robots without active weapons can also use this if they want more power and weight. Depending on robot design, this configuration could make a robot more maneuverable while also ensuring some stability. The total 24V could also last much longer while the robot is being used.


## Vex Batteries




This configuration is mandatory if you would like to design a robot with an active weapon. Robots without active weapons can also use this if they want more power and weight. Depending on robot design, this configuration could make a robot more maneuverable while also ensuring some stability. The total 24V could also last much longer while the robot is being used.
There is only one Vex Battery to each robot. The Vex battery connects to the receiver and powers it. ***MAKE SURE TO CONNECT THE BATTERY TO THE RECEIVER PROPERLY OR ELSE IT WILL BREAK THE RECEIVER.***
